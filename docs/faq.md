# FAQ

## My transaction is sometimes processing for a long time, why?
Sometimes the Aurora RPC doesn't deliver blocks on time for our TheGraph indexer. This is something that's been
worked on by their teams and will be resolved in the future.

Your transaction and NFTs are safe, it's just a matter of frontend.

## How can I list my collection on Endemic?
We are listing collections that show traction in the community. Let us know what you want to list on our discord and we'll get in touch.

## How can I get ETH on Aurora?
You can bridge your ETH from Ethereum via [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer) or swap via dex like [WannaSwap](https://wannaswap.finance/home).
