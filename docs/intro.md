# Intro

Endemic is a decentralized marketplace for digital assets on the Aurora blockchain enabling:
- **Artists** to get their work online, build portfolios, and sell art and interact with others
- **Collectors** to discover something rare and unique among a hand-picked number of world-class artists
- **Buyers** to invest in awesome pieces and get secure access to files confirming they are original

## Connecting through art and blockchain
The main feature of the Endemic is this — **users can all connect**.

Remember when you looked at the picture and wondered what’s the story behind it? What made the artists so sad or who’s that old man in the pencil made portrait? In Endemic, you can ask the artist just that (or anything you can think of) and truly understand the picture that caught your eye. 

With various integration such as **likes, comments, blogging**, etc., artists benefit from deeper connections with their supporters while collectors and buyers can experience the art much better before the purchase decision. Also, social interaction between users makes the platform a place truly full of life.

## What’s under the hood?
Premium art station — is the NFT marketplace which is custom made, artist creator centric on quality art with emphasized and developed social network components and adapted in the crypto sphere. We are doing it on **Aurora** and then bridging it to **Near** with integration.

Endemic is a specialized project, the result of testing with other platforms, learning, improving imperfections and giving it our final touch. Along the way, we already gathered a huge community and realized that we are ready.
